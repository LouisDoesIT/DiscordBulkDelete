# DiscordBulkDelete

Simple HTML/JS page that runs through the folder in order to export all the messageIDs.
You will have to request the Data from discord before starting here.

Please upload navigate directly to the fodler that contains all the Chat-Channels.
For example: c123783035579466464 

The Script will run through the folders, read the json files and push all the IDs into an Array.
This Array will export a CSV file. Since Discord only requested an CSV file with the messageIDs, this should suffice.
Keep in Mind that Discord will probably take like 3 Weeks or so to delete your messages.

First time using HTML / JS. Everything should be running locally. No external stuff.
This only exists because I am too dumb to use python.

Just download the file and run it yourself or go to
