    <textarea>Hello,

I am writing to formally request the deletion of all my messages listed in the attached text document, in accordance with the GDPR. As a resident of Germany, I am exercising my right to data privacy and protection. The attached document contains a list of messages in the required format, as the volume is too large to include within the body of this email.
        
I understand that context preservation may be a concern; however, my right to privacy is of paramount importance. Unfortunately, Discord appears to lack comprehensive tools for users to manage their data effectively at this scale.
        
Thank you very much for your attention to this matter, and I appreciate your assistance in helping me secure my privacy.
        
Please let me know once the deletion process is complete, as I would like to request another data package to verify that all listed messages have been deleted.
        
Best regards, </textarea>
    <p> Message date: 01/Dec/24</p>
    <p> Hi there, <br>
 
        Thank you for your continued patience. <br>
         
        The deletion process for the message IDs you provided is now complete. <br>
         
        If any of the provided message IDs were sent by another user, they would not have been deleted. Additionally, if any of the message IDs were incorrect or missing a number, they would not have been processed. <br>
         
        If you locate additional message IDs containing personally identifiable information (PII) that you would like to request for deletion, please submit a new ticket with the relevant details, and our team will review them accordingly. <br>
        
        Finally, please note that we will be expecting a CSV format starting Dec 1, 2024 and will be rejecting any other file formats after that date. <br>
         
        We appreciate your understanding in this matter. <br>
         
        Sincerely, <br>
        Discord Privacy Team </p>
